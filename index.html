				<h3 class="major">ClassCloud</h3>

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/ClassCloud-poster.webp" alt="" /></span>
				<p>ClassCloud is an innovative educational website designed to facilitate
					collaborative learning for younger children and parents. Through interactive features,
					including educational video resources and short quizzes, ClassCloud empowers children to gain a
					deeper understanding of a wide range of topics, while simultaneously providing parents with valuable
					insights into how much time their children spend actively studying.
					<br>
					With ClassCloud, learning is not just a solitary activity, but rather an immersive and enjoyable
					experience that can be shared by parents and children alike.
				</p>

				<p>This was developed using JavaScript, PHP, CSS, and HTML and runs on a
					MySQL database utilizing <a href="https://www.usbwebserver.net/webserver/"
						target="_blank">USBWEBSERVER</a> for enhanced portability.Additionally, I utilized the powerful
					testing capabilities of Python and Selenium for faster and more efficient testing.
					<br>
					In order to provide full transparency and promote
					best practices, I have created a <a
						href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XHldCfklCUGSwFDmXfx0vxNYQR1D_xEq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113659250904504719311&rtpof=true&sd=true"
						target="_blank">
						comprehensive technical documentation </a> totaling 165 pages. This
					documentation includes critical components such as requirement analysis (SRS), UML diagrams,
					Software Design Specification (SDD), and a testing document, among others.
					<br>

					As a testament to its quality and innovation, the project received an impressive 90% grade upon
					completion. For those interested in exploring the project in greater detail, the code is available
					for

				<p>This website features a sleek and intuitive landing page, complete with user-friendly login and
					signup interfaces for both parents and students. Upon authentication, students are seamlessly
					redirected to the educational portal, while parents are directed to the parent portal and admins to
					the admin page.
					<br><br>

					To ensure that the website is tailored to meet the unique needs of its users, students are
					redirected to different pages based on their age, with a particular focus on simple topics that are
					easily digestible for a younger demographic. This approach reflects our unwavering commitment to
					providing a high-quality and accessible educational experience for all users.

				<p> Our educational platform offers a comprehensive programming course for seventh-grade
					students. This page utilizes the user-friendly and convenient <a
						href="https://pyscript.net/">PyScript's</a>
					API, which allows real-time Python
					interpreter, allowing students to seamlessly follow educational programming content. With PyScript,
					students can engagingly practice their programming skills, offering a
					unique educational experience.
					<br><br>
					In addition to our programming course, our website features an innovative and intuitive sidebar with
					a built-in YouTube search. This feature was inspired by the realization that users frequently turn
					to YouTube to gain a deeper understanding of various topics. With our built-in YouTube search, users
					can efficiently and conveniently search for videos to fix or understand errors, streamlining the
					learning process and promoting a more effective and immersive educational experience.

				<p>The parent portal offers a user-friendly interface that provides valuable insights into the
					performance and learning habits of their child. telling us information on our child-like
					what their best and worst grades are,
					and more importantly how much time have they actually been studying on the website.
					<br><br>
					This feature is
					made possible through the implementation of an asynchronous JavaScript timer, which is highly
					intelligent and can detect when a child is actively engaged in a learning session. The timer checks
					whether the student has their mouse on the tab and is actively participating in a course, and then
					promptly sends this data back to the database for real-time analysis. This allows parents to take a
					quick and comprehensive look at their child's study habits, providing them with an effective
					tool for tracking their child's study time and making informed educational decisions.

				<h3 class="major"> Undefeatable Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>


				<img class="image main" style="height: 130%;width:100%;" src="images/Animation5AI.webp" loading="lazy"
					decoding="async">

				<p>This project is the well-known Tic-Tac-Toe pen and paper-game with an AI utilizing the min-max
					algorithm to make it impossible to defeat
					<br><br>
					meaning you can either end in a tie or the AI will win, the reason for this is that the minmax
					implementation works by exploring all possible moves and counter-moves, building a game tree of all
					possible future states of the game. At each level of the tree, it alternates between maximizing the
					player's score and minimizing the opponent's score.
					The algorithm then chooses the move that leads to the best possible outcome for the player.
					<br><br>
					By leveraging the p5.js library, this website is able to render the game board in a visually
					pleasing manner and enable user interaction through the drawing of X's and O's, providing a highly
					effective solution for this type of project.
					For more information about how this works, you can check out my <a

					<br>The home page of the website boasts a visually unique design. It features a dynamic
					background GIF that seamlessly moves behind the large, transparent text, creating an eye-catching
					and
					captivating aesthetic.

				<h3 class="major">Angular Project</h3>

				<img class="image main" style="height: 130%;width:100%;" src="images/Animation4angular.webp"
					loading="lazy" decoding="async">

				<p>During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting Angular project that provided me
					with an in-depth understanding of Angular and Angular Material. The project involved the development
					of custom components and API integration to retrieve survey data, which was then displayed based on
					its categorization as either closed, published, or expired.

					To enhance the user experience, I leveraged Angular Material to create visually appealing and highly
					functional tabs that provided users with the ability to view all surveys at a glance. Overall, this
					project was an excellent opportunity for me to further develop my Angular skills and enhance my
					knowledge of web development best practices.</p>
